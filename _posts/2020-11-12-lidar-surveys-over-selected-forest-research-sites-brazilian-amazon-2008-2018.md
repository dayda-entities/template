This dataset provides the complete catalog of point cloud data collected during LiDAR surveys over selected forest research sites across the Amazon rainforest in Brazil between 2008 and 2018 for the Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project. Flight lines were selected to overfly key field research sites in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo. The point clouds have been georeferenced, noise-filtered, and corrected for misalignment of overlapping flight lines. They are provided in 1 km2 tiles. The data were collected to measure forest canopy structure across Amazonian landscapes to monitor the effects of selective logging on forest biomass and carbon balance, and forest recovery over time.
