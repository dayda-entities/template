This data sets reports diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements in the old-growth upland forest at the Para Western (Santarem) - km 67, Primary Forest Tower Site. This site is in the Tapajos National Forest located in north central Brazil. Measurements were made periodically from July 1999 through August 2005.Trees with DBH >35cm were measured for ~2600 trees in four 5ha transects. Trees >10cm were measured in a smaller area (Rice et al., 2004). Measurements were made in 1999, 2001, and 2005. Trees are identified by local common names.  A cross reference to scientific names is provided as a companion file.Coarse woody debris and litter samples and measurements were collected same area. See related data sets.
