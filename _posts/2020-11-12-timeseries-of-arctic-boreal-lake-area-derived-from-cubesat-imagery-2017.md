This dataset provides near-daily lake area timeseries for 85,358 lakes across four study areas in Northern Canada and Alaska, USA, between May 1 and October 1, 2017. These lake area estimates were produced using digital images from newly developed Planet Labs CubeSats, small satellites with a 4-band (blue, green, red, near-infrared) camera payload. In constellation, CubeSats collected imagery at very high spatial (3-5m) and temporal (near-daily) resolution. From the imagery, each lake's mean, minimum, and maximum areas and seasonal dynamism were derived. The dataset covers four Arctic-Boreal regions: the Yukon Flats Basin (YFB) in eastern interior Alaska, and the Mackenzie River Valley (MRV), Canadian Shield Transect (CST), and Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) in Canada.
