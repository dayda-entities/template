This data set provides vegetation species abundance data collected in 1975 from 60 sites on the Arctic Coastal Plain near Atqasuk, Alaska, as well as environmental and species data for 31 of the sites that were revisited in 2000 and 2010. The study sites are located on Arctic tundra near the Meade River, about 60 miles southwest of Barrow. Data includes baseline plot information for vegetation and site factors for the study plots subjectively located in 9 plant communities. Specific attributes include: site characteristics such as altitude, slope, aspect, and topographic position; soil pH and organic layer depth; and dominant plant communities. This product brings together for easy reference all of the available information collected from the plots that has been used for the classification, mapping, and analysis of geo-botanical factors at the Atqasuk research sites and across Alaska.
