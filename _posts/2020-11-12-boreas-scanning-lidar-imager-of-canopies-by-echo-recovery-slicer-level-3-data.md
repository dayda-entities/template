Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery (SLICER) data were acquired in support of BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) at all of the Tower Flux (TF) sites in the Southern and Northern Study Areas (SSA and NSA, respectively) and along transects between the study areas.  Data were acquired on 5 days between 18 and 30 July 1996. Each coverage of a tower site is typically 40 km in length, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 lines across each tower oriented in a variety of azimuths. The SLICER data were acquired simultaneously with Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) hyperspectral, multiview angle images. The SLICER Level 3 products consist of binary files for each flight line with a data record for each laser shot composed of 13 parameters and a 600-byte waveform that is the raw record of the back scatter laser energy reflected from Earth's surface.
