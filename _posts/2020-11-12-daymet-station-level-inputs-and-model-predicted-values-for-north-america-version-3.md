This data set reports the station-level daily weather observation data and the corresponding Daymet model predicted data for three Daymet model parameters: minimum temperature (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax), and daily total precipitation (prcp). Each data file contains the daily observations and Daymet model predicted values for one variable and one year (1980 - the current full calendar year) for stations across North America. Also included are corresponding station metadata files for each variable and year, including the station name, station identification, latitude, and longitude.
