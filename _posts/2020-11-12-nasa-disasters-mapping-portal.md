This entry does not contain data itself, it is for the website, the NASA Disasters Mapping Portal: https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov

The Disasters Mapping Portal contains numerous datasets that can be streamed from the Portal into GIS software. 

The Disasters Applications area promotes the use of Earth observations to improve prediction of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from natural and technological disasters. Disaster applications and applied research on natural hazards support emergency mitigation approaches, such as early warning systems, and providing information and maps to disaster response and recovery teams.
