The monthly ocean bottom pressure anomaly grids are given as equivalent water thickness changes derived from GRACE & GRACE-FO time-variable gravity observations during the specified timespan, and relative to the specified time-mean reference period. The Equivalent water thickness represent sea floor pressure changes due to the integral effect of ocean and atmosphere processes, including global mean ocean bottom pressure changes (mean ocean mass and mean atmosphere mass over the global oceans). The Level-2 GAD product has been added back, a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) correction has been applied, and standard corrections for geocenter (degree-1), C20 (degree-20) and C30 (degree-30) are incorporated. Post-processing filters (i.e., de-striping and spatial smoothing) have been applied to reduce correlated errors. Version 03 (v03) of the ocean bottom pressure data uses updated and consistent C20 and Geocenter corrections (i.e., Technical Notes TN-14 and TN-13).Data grids are provided in ASCII/netCDF/GeoTIFF formats. For the RL06 version, all GRACE products in the ASCII format have adopted the YAML encoding header, which is in full compliance with the PO.DAAC metadata best practices.
