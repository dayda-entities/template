The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor.

This dataset on data.nasa.gov was a one-time export from the Global Landslide Catalog maintained separately. It is current as of March 7, 2016. The original catalog is available here: http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.nccs.nasa.gov%2Fserver%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fglobal_landslide_catalog%2Fglc_viewer_service%2FFeatureServer&source=sd
