The monthly land mass grids contain water mass anomalies given as equivalent water thickness derived from GRACE & GRACE-FO time-variable gravity observations during the specified timespan, and relative to the specified time-mean reference period. The Equivalent water thickness represents the total terrestrial water storage anomalies from soil moisture, snow, surface water (incl. rivers, lakes, reservoirs etc.), as well as groundwater and aquifers. A glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) correction has been applied, and standard corrections for geocenter (degree-1), C20 (degree-20) and C30 (degree-30) are incorporated. Post-processing filters have been applied to reduce correlated errors. Version 03 (v03) of the terrestrial water storage data uses updated and consistent C20 and Geocenter corrections (i.e., Technical Notes TN-14 and TN-13).Data grids are provided in ASCII/netCDF/GeoTIFF formats. For the RL06 version, all GRACE products in the ASCII format have adopted the YAML encoding header, which is in full compliance with the PO.DAAC metadata best practices.
