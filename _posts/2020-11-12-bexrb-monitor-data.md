This is a monitor using data from Swift/BAT, MAXI and Fermi/GBM instruments. 
Click on the table header to change the sorting behaviour. 
Color code for the probability: (rising flux , no change, decreasing flux)
The average flux is calculated as the average of the last 3 days of data, without taking the errors into account. The fermi flux is not given in mCrab. 
Please note that the accuracy of the probabilities is limited by the accuracy of the data used.
