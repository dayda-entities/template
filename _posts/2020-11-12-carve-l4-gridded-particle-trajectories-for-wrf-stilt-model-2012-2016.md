This data set provides Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model inputs for particle receptors located at positions along Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) flight paths (2012 - 2015) and various meteorological stations in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. Each product consists of multiple NetCDF files packaged as a TAR/GZIP file. These data correspond to WRF-STILT model footprint data also generated by the CARVE science team.
