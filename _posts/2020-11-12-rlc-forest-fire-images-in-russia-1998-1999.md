This data set is made up of images of forest fires in Russia from NOAA's Operational Significant Event Imagery (OSEI) archive (http://www.osei.noaa.gov) for the 1998 and 1999 seasons. OSEI fire products include multichannel color composite imagery of wildfire and controlled burn events. Products in this event group show fire, smoke, and hotspots (FSMHS) from the fires.
