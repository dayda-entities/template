This dataset includes 30-m gridded estimates of total plant aboveground biomass (AGB), the shrub AGB, and the shrub dominance (shrub/plant AGB) for non-water portions of the Beaufort Coastal Plain and Brooks Foothills ecoregions of the North Slope of Alaska. The estimates were derived by linking biomass harvests from 28 published field site datasets with NDVI from a regional Landsat mosaic derived from Landsat 5 and 7 satellite imagery. The data cover the period 2007-06-01 to 2016-08-31.
