The OMB Office of the Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) has a long-standing practice of making information about Federal IT available to the public through various tools and reports to Congress. Consistent with this practice, OMB OFCIO will be making agency cost savings and avoidances data available to the public via http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/e-gov. This dataset links to NASA's Realized Cost Savings and Avoidances data in JSON format.
