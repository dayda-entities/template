This dataset provides CO2 and CH4 fluxes and meteorological parameters from five eddy covariance (EC) tower sites located at Barrow (three sites), Atqasuk (ATQ) and Ivotuk (IVO), Alaska. These locations form a 300-km north-south transect across Alaska's North Slope. Flux measurements include CO2, CH4, and H2O fluxes plus sensible and latent heat fluxes. Meteorological data include air temperature, wind speed, rain, soil temperature, PAR, radiation, soil water content, RH, ground heat fluxes, and air pressure. All data are reported at half-hourly intervals and cover the period 2015-01-01 to 2017-03-09.
