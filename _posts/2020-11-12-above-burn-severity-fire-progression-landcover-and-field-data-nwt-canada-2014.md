This data set provides peatland landcover classification maps, fire progression maps, and vegetation community biophysical data collected from areas that were burned by wildfire in 2014 in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The peatland maps include peatland type (bog, fen, marsh, swamp) and level of biomass (open, forested). The fire progression maps enabled an assessment of wildfire progression rates at a daily time scale. Field data, collected in 2015, include an estimate of burn severity, woody seedling/sprouting data, soil moisture, and tree diameter and height of burned sites and similar vegetation characterization at landcover validation sites.
