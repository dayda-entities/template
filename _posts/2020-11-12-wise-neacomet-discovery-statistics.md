These tables show discovery statistics for NEAs and comets discovered by NASA's WISE mission - now renamed to NEOWISE. The first small table shows the number of NEAs, PHAs (a sub-group of NEAs), and comets discovered to-date (within a day or two). The second table shows each object discovered, sorted by designation, with selected parameters describing the object's orbit.
