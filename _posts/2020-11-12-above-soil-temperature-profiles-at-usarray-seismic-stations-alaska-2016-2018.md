This dataset includes soil temperature profile measurements taken three times per day at 20 seismic monitoring sites associated with the USArray program, located across the NASA ABoVE domain in interior Alaska. Data were collected primarily from the summer of 2017 through the summer of 2018. At one station, measurements start in 2016. These measurements were taken using temperature probes installed at four depths from the surface to a target maximum depth of 1.5 meters and recorded with HOBO data loggers.
